            <p>My name is Marlisa and I am a Software Engineer focused on the front-end. I just left a full stack role to focus on a frontend design oriented path. Currently I am learning ThreeJs and React Three Fiber which is why I started this project. I do plan on having some of those projects here when I am done wiith them.</p>
            <p>I have interests in AI tools, the maker community and brand building. Just lurking, no indulging at the moment.</p>
            <p>My hobbies include Reading, Archery, Wood-working, Video Games and mindelssly watching TV. I used to be into Jiu-Jitsu but injuries happen. Right now, I am focusing on lifting <span>Barbells and Sandbags.</span></p>
