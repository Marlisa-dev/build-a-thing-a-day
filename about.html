            <p>My name is Marlisa. I was born and raised in Nigeria and life has brought me to Texas where I currently reside. I am a Software Engineer focused on the front-end. I lurk in the maker and AI community and spend an unghealthy amount of time on Youtube and Tiktok.</p>
            <p>I lurk in the maker and AI community and spend an unhealthy amount of time on Youtube and Tiktok. My hobbies are Reading, Archery and Wood-working. I used to be into Jiu-Jitsu but injuries happen. Right now, I am focusing on lifting <span>Barbells and Sandbags.</span></p>

            <h3>I started this project for a few reasons.</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>To prevent athrophy for those times where we I busy with non-code things</li>
                <li>Show improvement over time. All the best devs were first beginners</li>
                <li>A mini portfolio so to speak</li>
                <li>Serve as a personal visual repository</li>
            </ol>
